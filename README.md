# Cat & Dog Convolutional Neural Network Classifier

By: J. E. Salgado-Hernández

Image classifier for cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network. Dataset was from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats) competition. On test set, the accuracy reached up to 84%.

## Requirements
```
* python 3.9
* keras 3.5.0
* matplotlib 3.7.1
* tensorflow 2.17.0
```

For a more complete environment. Use the following command using **conda** to create a virtual environment.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
